In this mini project, I learned the importance of error handling in shell scripting to improve script reliability and prevent failures during execution. I explored how errors can arise from various scenarios such as invalid user input, system resource issues, or repeated executions that may cause conflicts like duplicate AWS S3 buckets. I implemented error handling using conditional statements to check the exit status of commands and designed the script to verify the existence of S3 buckets before attempting to create them. This approach prevents redundant bucket creation and provides clear, informative messages to guide users when errors occur. Overall, I gained valuable experience in building more robust and user-friendly shell scripts through proactive error anticipation and management.
