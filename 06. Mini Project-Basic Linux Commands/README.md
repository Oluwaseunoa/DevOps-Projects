# Mini Project - Linux Basic Commands 

## 1. What is a Linux Command?

A Linux command is an instruction that you input into the Linux terminal to perform a specific task. It typically consists of:
- **Command Name**: The main instruction (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`).
- **Option or Flag**: Additional options to modify behavior (e.g., `ls -a`, where `-a` is a flag).
- **Parameter or Argument**: The target (e.g., `cd /home/user`, `/home/user` is the argument).

**Note**: Linux is **case-sensitive**. `CD` and `cd` are different commands.

## 2. Manipulating Files and Directories

In Linux, manipulating files and directories is essential for organizing data, installing software, and managing the system.

Here are some common operations:

- **Creating a directory**:
    ```bash
    mkdir my_directory
    ```

- **Changing into a directory**:
    ```bash
    cd my_directory
    ```
![changing directory](./img/2.cd.png)
- **Creating a file**:
    ```bash
    touch myfile.txt
    ```
![Creating file](./img/3.touch.png)
- **Viewing files in a directory**:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
![Listing files](./img/4.ls.png)
- **Moving a file**:
    ```bash
    mv myfile.txt /home/username/Documents/
    ```
![Moving file](./img/5.mv.png)

- **Deleting a file**:
    ```bash
    rm myfile.txt
    ```
![Removing files](./img/6.rm.png)

- **Deleting a directory**:
    ```bash
    rmdir my_directory
    ```
    ![Removing folder](./img/7.rmdir.png)

## 3. Using `sudo` Command

- **Without `sudo`**:
    ```bash
    mkdir /root/myfolder
    ```
    **Result**:
    ```
    mkdir: cannot create directory â€˜/root/myfolderâ€™: Permission denied
    ```
    ![creating folder in root folder](./img/8.rootwithoutsudo.png)

- **With `sudo`**:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /root/myfolder
    ```
![Sudo Creating folder in the root folder](./img/9.withsudo.png)

- **Verify folder creation**:
    ```bash
    sudo ls /root
    ```
![Verifying created folder](./img/10.sudols.png)
---

## 4. `pwd` Command (Print Working Directory)

- **Command**:
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
- **Output**:
    ```
    /home/username
    ```

The `pwd` command shows the absolute path of the current working directory.

## 5. Linux Directory Structure

- `/` - Root directory (top of the hierarchy)
- `/bin` - Essential binary files (e.g., basic commands like `ls`, `cp`)
- `/etc` - Configuration files
- `/home` - Home directories for users
- `/root` - Home directory for root user
- `/var` - Variable files (logs, spool files)
- `/usr` - User programs and data

**Exploring with `ls`:**
```bash
ls /
ls /bin
ls /etc
ls /home
ls /root
ls /var
ls /usr
```
---

## 6. `cd` Command (Change Directory)

- Navigate to root:
    ```bash
    cd /
    pwd
    ```
    **Output**:
    ```
    /
    ```
![Chanding directory to root](./img/12.cdroot.png)
- List contents:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
![List root files and directories](./img/13.lsroot.png)
- Navigate into `/usr`:
    ```bash
    cd usr
    pwd
    ```
![Change directory to usr](./img/14.cdusr.png)
---

## 7. Side Hustle Task 1 â€” Creating Directories

- Create a `photos` directory inside `/usr`:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /usr/photos
    ```
- Navigate into `photos`:
    ```bash
    cd /usr/photos
    ```
![Creating folder in usr](./img/15.mkdirphotos.png)

- Create 3 random folders inside `photos`:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir folder2 folder3 folder4
    ```
- Show newly created folders:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
![Creating and listing multiple folders](./img/16.mkdirmultiplephotos.png)
- Navigate into one folder:
    ```bash
    cd folder1
    ```
- Show full path:
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
    **Output**:
    ```
    /usr/photos/folder1
    ```

## 8. Using `ls` Command

- List contents of a directory:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
![List content of a directory]()
- List recursively:
    ```bash
    ls -R
    ```
![List folder recursively](./img/18.lsrecursive.png)
- List hidden files:
    ```bash
    ls -a
    ```
![List hidden items](./img/19.lshiddenfile.png)

- List in human-readable format:
    ```bash
    ls -lh
    ```
![List human readably](./img/20.lslh.png)

---

## 9. Using `cat` Command

- Display content of a file:
    ```bash
    cat /etc/os-release
    ```
- **Output Example**:
    ```
    NAME="Ubuntu"
    VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
    ID=ubuntu
    ...
    ```

## 10. Using `cp` Command

- **Copy a single file**:
    ```bash
    cp file1.txt /home/username/
    ```
    ![Copy file1 to home](./img/22.file1tohome.png)

- **Copy multiple files**:
    ```bash
    cp file1.txt file2.txt /home/username/
    ```
![Copy multiple files to home](./img/23.cpmultiplefile.png)


- **Copy a file to a new file**:
    ```bash
    cp file1.txt file1_backup.txt
    ```
